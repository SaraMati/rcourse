## Intro to Git

Git is a version control system that tracks changes in files. Although
it is primarily used for software development, Git can be used to track
changes in any files, and is an indispensable tool for collaborative projects. Using Git, we effectively create different versions of our files and track who has made what changes. The complete history of the changes for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. 

to sync the repository across different computers and to collaborate with others, Git is often used via [GitHub](http://www.github.com), a web-based service that hosts Git repositories. In the spirit of 'working open' and ensuring scientific 
reproducibility, it has also become increasingly common for scientists to upload 
scripts and related files to GitHub for others to use.

In this lesson, we'll be covering some basic Git commands, before
moving on to using GitHub for the upcoming group projects.
All members of the group will be given admin access to a pre-made repository. 

### Command line Git

#### Setup and Installation

Git is primarily used on the command line. The implementation of the
command line that we'll be using is known as a 'bash interpreter', or
'shell'. While bash interpreters are natively available on Mac and Linux 
operating systems, Windows users may have to externally install a bash shell.

To install Git on a **Mac**, you will have to install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12),
which can be downloaded from the Mac App store. Be warned: Xcode is a very 
large download (approximately 6 GB)! Install Xcode and Git should be
ready for use. (_Note: most students will have already installed Xcode
already for some R packages we used earlier in the course. If you're not
sure whether this is the case, run the `git --version` command described
below_)

To install Git (and Bash) on **Windows**, download [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) from its [website](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.19.1.windows.1). 
At the time of writing, 2.19.1 is the most recent version. Download the `exe`
file to get started. Git for Windows provides a program called Git Bash, which
provides a bash interpreter that can also run Git commands. 

To install Git for **Linux**, use the preferred package manager
for your distribution and follow the instructions [listed here](https://git-scm.com/download/linux). 

To test whether Git has successfully been installed, open a bash interpreter, type

```
git --version
```

and hit enter. If the interpreter returns a version number, Git has been
installed.

#### Bash Primer

Before we can use Git in the bash interpreter, it's worth learning a
few basic bash commands. All bash commands are run simply by typing them 
into the interpreter and pressing enter. 

```
pwd
```

`pwd`, or 'print working directory', will return the folder bash
is currently in. This is similar to the concept of the working directory in R
that we discussed earlier in the course.

```
cd [folder]
```

`cd` changes the current working directory. This is useful in tandem with
`~`, which is shorthand for 'home directory' in bash (usually 
`/Users/[yourname]`). To navigate to your Desktop, the command would be 
`cd ~/Desktop`. 

`cd ..` will let you move back up one folder. If your current working
directory is `/Users/[yourname]/Desktop`, for instance, `cd ..` will
change it to `/Users/[yourname]`. 

```
ls
```

`ls` will return what files/folders are within the current 
working directory. This is useful when you have just used `cd` to 
change your current directory and need a quick reminder of what's
in said directory. 

```
mkdir [foldername]
```

`mkdir`, or 'make directory', will create a new directory with
the specified name. For instance, `mkdir thesis` will create a folder
called `thesis`, which can then be entered with `cd thesis`.

```
nano [filename]
```

`nano` is a text editor for unix-like systems that opens right within the bash window. If the filename provided doesn't 
refer to an existing file, `nano` will create a new file with that name. 
Once you're done with `nano`, press Control + X to exit - `nano` will ask 
whether you want to save your work, which can be answered by pressing either 
`y` or `n`. Alternatively, Control + O followed by Enter will save your current 
work, after which Control + X will exit without prompting.

You can use any other text editor based on your system, for example, Notepad on Windows. 

#### Getting started with Git

First, we have to tell Git who we are. This is especially important
when collaborating with Git and keeping track of who did what!
Keep in mind that this only has to be done the first time we're using Git.

This is done with the `git config` command. When using Git, _all_ commands begin
with `git`, followed by more specific subcommands. 

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@email.com"
```

Next, we have to set a default text editor for Git. 
Here, we'll use `nano`, as mentioned above:

```
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

here is a [link](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html) to instructions on how to config other text editors. 

use the following to review and your Git configurations:

```
git config --list
```

#### Version control with Git
Note: *Material for the following section of the class was taught from [Software Carpentry](www.software-carpentry.org)'s openly available Intro to Git lesson,
which is available in its entirety [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).* 

Material covered in class, in order:

- [Creating a repository](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-create/index.html)
- [Tracking changes](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/04-changes/index.html)
- [Exploring history](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/05-history/index.html)

##### Summary: Basic Git commands

- `git init` (or `git clone`)
- `git status`
- `git log`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git checkout`

#### Branching

Git commit history is a [directed acyclic
graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (or DAG), which
means that every single commit always has at least one 'parent' commit (the
previous commit(s) in the history), and any individual commit can have multiple
'children'. This history can be traced back through the 'lineage' or
'ancestry'.

##### What are branches?

Branches are simply a *named pointer* to a commit in the DAG, which
automatically *move forward* as commits are made. Divergent commits (two
commits with the same parent) could be considered "virtual" branches. Since
they are simply pointers, branches in Git are very lightweight.

![Examples of branching](image/branches.svg)

##### Why use them?

- To keep experimental work separate
- To separate trials
- To ease collaboration
- To separate bug fixes from development

Since you will be using Github, we will learn how to make branches in the second section of the lesson when we learn about GitHub.


## Collaborating with GitHub

Although command line Git is very useful, GitHub allows for easy use of
Git for collaborative purposes using a primarily point-and-click interface,
in addition to providing a web-based hosting service for Git repositories (or 'repos'). 
If you have not already made a GitHub account, do so now [here](www.github.com).

All groups have been provided with existing repositories, but a new
repository can be made by clicking on the `+` in the top right of the page
and selecting 'New repository'. For now, however, navigate to
your provided group repo.

### Creating a fork

The repos that have already been created can be thought of as 'main
repos', which will contain the 'primary' version of the repo at any
given point in time. However, instead of directly uploading and editing
files right within this main repo itself, we will begin by _forking_ the
repo. When a given user forks a repo, GitHub creates a user-specific copy
of the repo and all its files.

To fork your group's repo, navigate to the repo's page and click on the
'Fork' button at the top right of the page. Following a brief load
screen, GitHub will redirect you to your new, forked repo.

You'll notice that on the top left of this repo page, the repo's name
will be '[your username] / [repo name]', as opposed to 'EEB313 / [repo name]'.
Furthermore, GitHub will indicate that this is a fork right underneath
said repo name ('forked from eeb313-2018/ [repo name]'). 

### Branches and Pull Requests

Currently, your fork is identical to what the original repo looked like
at the moment of forking, and so GitHub will indicate that the fork
is currently 'even' with its original. Any edits that are made in
the fork will be unique to the fork, leaving the original unchanged.

But how do you add these changes to the main repo? Doing so is
a two step process:

1. First, create a _branch_ on your _fork_ (not the main repo). This is yet 
another copy of the fork (a copy of a copy!) that will store changes separately 
from 'master', which is the default branch. 

2. Once you have made our changes in this branch, submit what's
known as a _pull request_ from this edited branch to the main repo. This 
allows your changes to be reviewed by the other members of your group before 
they are merged into the main repo.

Although this process may seem a bit laborious, using this method (also known as
the 'GitHub flow') minimizes chances of error and ensures that all code
is reviewed by at least one other person. Understanding how and why this process works
is key to collaborative work in software development and the like, and is used
by all sorts of open source projects on GitHub ([including `dplyr` itself](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr)!)

#### Creating a new branch

In a given repo, there is a 'Branch: master' button just above the
list of files. Clicking on this will bring up a dropdown menu containing a list
of branches (which currently just contains `master`) and a text field.
A new branch can be created by typing in the text field. Start by making
a new branch called `initial-edit` using said text field. GitHub
will then refresh, and the button will now say 'Branch: initial-edit'
instead.

![_Pictured: the branch dropdown menu_](image/branch_dropdown.png)

The dropdown can now be used to switch back to `master`, but let's stay
in `initial-edit` for now. This is the place to make new changes -- 
either by editing existing files or creating new ones. Let's create
a simple Rmd file with the 'Create new file' button on the right side
of the repo page.

````

author: "Your Name"
output: pdf_document
---

Hello! This is my R notebook.

```{r}`r ''`
print('Hello, GitHub!')
```

````

![_Pictured: editing a file on GitHub_](image/sample_rmd.png)

Once done, scroll to the bottom of the page and add a commit message 
using the text file -- something like 'initial Rmd file creation' --
and then click on 'Commit new file'. 

#### Pull requests

After a commit has been made, GitHub takes you back to the main repo
page, but now with an attention-grabbing yellow prompt about these
new edits. GitHub has noticed that your fork has a new branch with
edits, and over on the right side of the prompt, GitHub presents the
option of creating a pull request.

![_Pictured: GitHub's pull request prompt_](image/yellow_prompt.png)

If you don't see the yellow prompt, head to your fork and switch to the
branch containing your edits. Underneath the green 'Clone or download' 
button, there is a 'Pull request' option -- this can be used to open
a pull request instead. You'll also notice that the left side of this
bar lists how many commits ahead of `master` your branch currently is.

Following either method of opening a pull request, GitHub takes you to
the 'Pull requests' tab of the _main repo_ and prompts you to write about
your pull request. Here, you can (and should) explain the changes you've
made for your group members, so that they know what to look for and review.
Be specific and detailed to save your group members' time -- it's a good
idea to start off your pull request message with an overall summary 
('adding `dplyr` code to clean dataset') followed by a point-form list of
what changes have been made, if necessary. 

Once the pull request has been made, GitHub will list both your message
and your commit messages below. You also have the option of merging the
pull request yourself -- but _don't do this_! When collaborating, always
have someone else review and merge your pull request. 

If all does _not_ look good, your team members can add messages below, and
tag others using the @ symbol, similarly to most social networks. If
more changes are needed before the pull request is ready to merge, 
any new commits you make to the branch on your fork (`initial-edit` in
our case here) will automatically be added on to the pull request.
This way, you can incorporate any changes or fixes suggested by your
team members simply by continuing to work in your fork's new branch
until your changes are ready to merge.

Once a pull request has been merged into the main repo, the branch on your fork 
isn't needed anymore. Because of this, GitHub will immediately prompt you to delete
the `initial-edit` branch as soon as the merge has been completed. 

![_Pictured: GitHub's branch deletion prompt_](image/delete_branch.png)

Great work -- your edits are now on the main repo!

#### Syncing your fork

There's one issue with the above, though -- now, the `master` branch
on your fork is out of date with the current state of the main repo.
The fork has to be synced to remedy this issue. 

First, head to your fork on GitHub, and click on the green 'Clone or 
download' button on the right side of the page. This yields a link 
to your fork. Copy this link to your clipboard.

Next, open a bash shell, and navigate over to whichever folder you would
like a copy of your repo to be saved in. Then, run:

```
git clone [repo link]
```

This process, known as _cloning_, will create a new folder in your current 
working directory that contains the contents of your fork. Enter this new 
folder with `cd` and type `git status` to make sure the repo has been cloned 
properly. `git status` should output that the branch is even with `origin/master`, 
indicating that it is currently the same as the current state of your fork. 

To get your fork up to date with the main repo, you next have to add a _remote_ 
linking to the main repo. Head to your group's repo and once again click
on 'Clone or download' to grab its link. Then, using the main repo link, run:

```
git remote add upstream [repo link]
```

Once this is done, run:

```
git remote -v
```

to get a list of existing remotes. This should return four links,
two of which are labelled `origin` and two of which are labelled `upstream`.

Next, you have to _fetch_ the new changes that are in the main repo. 

```
git fetch upstream
```

Once the edits have been downloaded, merge them into your local repo:

```
git merge upstream/master
```

Your local copy is now even with the main repo! Finally,
push these changes to the GitHub version of your fork:

```
git push origin master
```

and now the GitHub version of the fork is all synced up, ready for
your next batch of edits, and eventually another pull request!

#### Keeping your fork up to date

When other group members add to the main repo through their own
pull requests, you have to make sure those edits have been incorporated
into your repo before making new changes of your own. This ensures
that there aren't any conflicts within files, wherein your edits
clash with someone else's if one of you is working with an earlier 
version of the file.

To remain up to date, navigate to the local copy of your repo using
bash, and once again repeat the above steps:

```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master
```
Note: 
The `git pull` command combines two other commands, `git fetch` and `git merge`.

This will download any changes your group members may have made
and update both the local and GitHub versions of your fork accordingly.
Before starting any edits of your own, it's usually a good idea to start off
by checking to see whether anything's been added to the main repo and, if needed,
then syncing your fork to account for that. 

#### Issues

Finally, each repo on GitHub also has an Issues tab at the top of the page.
Here, you and your group can create posts regarding the content of the
repo that highlight issues with code or serve as to-do lists to 
manage outstanding tasks with.

Although issues aren't needed for any of the steps we discussed above,
it can be useful to create a roadmap of your project with them and  
assign group members to specific tasks if need be. 

### To sum up

The 'GitHub flow':

1. Make sure your fork is up to date
2. Create a new branch on your fork
3. Make your edits (with informative commit messages along the way)
4. Submit a pull request
5. Have your group members review your pull request
6. If your group requests further edits prior to merging, make more commits in the new branch
7. Once your edits have been merged, delete your new edits-containing branch
8. Sync your fork to be up to date with the new changes
